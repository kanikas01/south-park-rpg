Assignment 4 - Browser game utilizing jQuery

This is a very basic RPG using characters from South Park. All game behavior is controlled from the [game.js](assets/javascript/game.js) file.

The game is designed for play on a desktop or laptop using near-full screen width and height; smaller screen sizes may result in odd text wrapping or element overlap.
