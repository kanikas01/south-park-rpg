Browser game utilizing jQuery

This is a very basic RPG using ancillary characters from South Park. All game behavior is controlled from the [game.js](assets/javascript/game.js) file. jQuery is used for all DOM manipulation, and the game code is a combination of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

The game is designed for play on a desktop or laptop using near-full screen width and height; smaller screen sizes may result in odd text wrapping or element overlap.

To create the layout, I designed a column system similar to the one used by Bootstrap. Column widths are defined at the top of the [style.css](assets/css/style.css) file.
